####I am just your average workaholic hippy ex-research scientist software developer.####
#####The early years#####
  My whole life I've loved science and science fiction so during college I was pretty sure I was going science but I wasn't sure which direction.  I was torn between Physics which I loved and which finally convinced me that Math was worth doing and Biology which was also super interesting.  
#####Time for a change#####
  I ended up choosing biology but after many years and a few degrees I started to get frustrated with the push to specialize.  I loved learning about lots of different things and wanted to be flexible enough to work on lots of different problems.  In order to do this I decided to switch paths and learn to program intending to do bioinformatics.  However, once I got started I fell in love with programming and building things with software and I decided to ditch research for software development.  And now here I am, still learning and building and loving every second of it.
#####The future#####
  Although it's hard to tell what the future will bring I am excited. I love my math and cs classes and am well on the way to becoming a computer science geek.
